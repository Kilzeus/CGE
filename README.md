# CGE
Carelia Game Engine

A hobby project that I have been working on my spare time. The engine side of the project is currently 
being migrated to GITHUB and the various subprojects are in varying stages of disarray. Some files appear
to have been left out of the initial commit and will be added back ASAP. The project currently has a lot of
dependencies that are not included here.

These include but are not necessarily limited to:

Bullet physics, Boost, FreeImage, FreeType, AssImp.

The versions used are old and I will be working on getting these updated for the project where it makes sense and
is benefitial to do so.
